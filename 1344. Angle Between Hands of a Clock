1344. Angle Between Hands of a Clock

Given two numbers, hour and minutes. Return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and the minute hand.

 
Input: hour = 12, minutes = 30
Output: 165

class Solution {
public:
    double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        double hrAngle = (hour * 60 + minutes) * 0.5;
        double minsAngle = minutes * 6;
        return min(360-(abs(hrAngle-minsAngle)),abs(hrAngle-minsAngle));
        
    }
};


/* Things learnt
** Hour angle takes 12 hours to complete 360 degrees meaning for every hour it takes 360/12 = 30 degrees.Also let's say when time is 2:20
the hour angle would move away from 2 and would be in the middle of 2 and 3 and it is proportional to minute hand.
** Minute hand travels 360 in 60 mins so 6 degrees per minute. Calculate and subtract to get the absolute solution
