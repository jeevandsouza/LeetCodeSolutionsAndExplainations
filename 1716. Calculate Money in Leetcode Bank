1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank

Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.

He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.
Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.

Input: n = 10
Output: 37
Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.

class Solution {
public:
    int totalMoney(int n) {
        int sum=0,interim=1,Monday=1,increment=0;
        while((increment++) !=n)
        {
            if(increment%7==1)
            {
                sum+=Monday;
                interim= Monday;
                Monday++;
            }
            else
                sum = sum+(++interim);
            }
        return sum;
    }
};

/*Things learnt
** This is solved in O(n), it says 100% better than other cpp solutions interms of time constraint
** but when we are solving math problem it is better to try to get a formula which would solve it in O(1)
** one approach that i got while googling this stuff can be seen in discusssion.
