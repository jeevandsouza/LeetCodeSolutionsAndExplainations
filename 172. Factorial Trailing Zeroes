	 recursive way of solving for facotrial.
	 
	 New lesson learnt was trailing zeros of a factorial can wefound out by diving them by 5, only 1,2,3,4 don't have trailing zeros 
	 for their factorials from 5 i,e 120 they have atleast one . example 10 is 3628800 has two zeros so 10/5 = 2 and thus it has two zeros.
