344. Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]


class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int start =0, end = s.size()-1;
        while(start < end)
        {
            swap(s[start],s[end]);
            start++;
            end--;
        }
        for(char ss:s)
            cout<<ss;
        cout<<endl;
    }
};

**swap function can be used to swap words
