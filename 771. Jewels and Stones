771. Jewels and Stones

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. 
Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

** Using hashing we can solve it in O(n) 
** One of the better solution that I saw was using count function sum+= count(s.begin(),s.end(),j[i]); which is faster
