961. N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array

In a array A of size 2N, there are N+1 unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated N times.

Input: [1,2,3,3]
Output: 3
class Solution {
public:
    int repeatedNTimes(vector<int>& A) {
        for(int i=0;i<A.size();i++)

        }
        return -1;
    }

** Using count effectively and solution is O(n) worst case, cppreference says count works at constant time complexity
